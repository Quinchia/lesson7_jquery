To enhance my recipe display applicaion, I added features
that displayed both instructions and ingredients at once when
your mouse hovers over the "Honey Garlic Salmon" title.
This avoids having to click or even hovering over seperate elements.

I also allowed for the background behind the salmon image to change to orange when 
hovering your mouse over the image.
